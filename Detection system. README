The idea is to creating a detection system for size based separation for a production line. 
To simulate that: 
1- chose IR sensor for detection of objects 
2- chose Arduino uno as controller 
3- chose the appropriate motor: servo to control the path of different sized objects in the production line 
4- designed a proof of concept circuitry 
5- programmed the circuit 
6- executed and tested the system
