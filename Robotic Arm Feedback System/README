Algorithm to creat a feedback robotic system 

1. To creat a feedback system, motors are controlled by another electrical element
                                         ⬇️
2. Potentiometers are used to control the motors 																				 
                                         ⬇️
3. Servo motor are used to provide high tourq and percision 
                                         ⬇️
4. Arduino is used as a control system and programming language 
                                         ⬇️
5. Circuit is connected by ➡️ supplying each servo motor with 5v, ground and digital signal ➡️ supplying each potentiometer with 5v, ground, analog signal ➡️ additional voltage (9v for arduino board and 6v for potentiometers )is added to operate the circuit 
                                         ⬇️
6. Program sketch is written to control the servo motors with potentiometers 
                                         ⬇️
7. System is tested
